      The project would build a web portal that can store messages/chat, reports, requests for appts, and somehow host video recordings (our old distance learning Tegrity system could do all that).   I am not up on what HIPPA would require to control access over the net/web, and would require as controls on the repository, in order to be legal.   Perhaps this fall could be phase I, developing the technology, and in Spring a group could lock it down and try to meet HIPPA standards.
